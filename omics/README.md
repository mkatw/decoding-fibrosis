# Omics Analysis for the CoCoMASLD Study

This repository contains code to analyse differential molecule expression results (transcriptomic and proteomic) from the CoCoMASLD cohort, linking them to histology-derived fibrosis metrics.

## Input Data

- Differential molecule expression results (population level), corrected for sex and BMI, with healthy volunteers excluded.
- Data generated by Gianluca Mazzoni and Lea MÃ¸rch Harder.

## Running the Analyses

### 1. Set up the environment

This project uses conda for environment management.

'conda env create -f envs/environment-omics.yml'
'conda activate omics-env'

Register the Jupyter kernel (one-time only):

'python -m ipykernel install --user --name=omics-env --display-name "Python (omics)"'

### 2. Open the notebooks

'jupyter notebook'

## Notes

All analyses are implemented in the Jupyter notebooks.
Shared functions are defined in 'utils.py'.
